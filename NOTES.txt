gentoo-builder/Dockerfile
    This creates a base system to build Gentoo images. Instances of this image
    have all the requirements for building Gentoo images. Package compilation
    and installation does not occur in this image, but happens in a container
    that is dynamically run by this builder image.

        ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/build.sh"]

    The build script accepts any package as its arguments.

        docker run -dt gentoo-builder app-misc/curl

    The build script does the following

        1. Validate the basic requirements for building a new image
            - a usable docker socket
            - an existing portage tree
            - the presence of arguments (packages to build)
            - a valid base Gentoo image to use
        2. Instanciate a base container in which the build will occur
            - docker run -dt -v /usr/portage:/usr/portage $base
        3. Update the portage tree
            - docker exec $cid emerge --sync -q
        4. Build the packages in the container
            - docker exec $cid emerge -q $packages
            - docker rm -fr /var/tmp/portage
        5. Stop the container after the build
        6. Commit the container to a new Gentoo image
            - image is named "gentoo-" + first 4 characters of $cid
            - add instruction VOLUME /usr/portage
            - add instruction VOLUME /var/tmp/portage
            - add instruction CMD ["/bin/bash"]
        7. Remove the stopped container


gentoo-base/Dockerfile
    This will create a base gentoo image without the portage tree. Other Gentoo
    images will be based on this one and will inherit characteristics of this
    image. Packages that should be in every derived Gentoo images can be
    included in this one.

        VOLUME /usr/portage
        VOLUME /var/tmp/portage
        CMD ["/bin/bash"]


docker run --volumes-from gentoo-builder -e PKGS="genkernel" gentoo-base
    Create a new container that starts building the package genkernel.
    The container will stop once the compilation is complete. The user creates
    the new gentoo image with docker commit.
